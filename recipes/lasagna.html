   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Lasagna is a popular Italian dish made by layering flat pasta noodles with a tomato-based meat sauce, ricotta cheese, and mozzarella cheese. The pasta is usually boiled beforehand, and the sauce can include ground beef or pork, onions, garlic, and herbs such as basil and oregano. The ricotta cheese is typically mixed with egg and sometimes other cheeses like Parmesan. The layers are assembled in a baking dish and baked in the oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Lasagna is often served as a main course and is a hearty and comforting dish enjoyed by many people around the world.</p>
